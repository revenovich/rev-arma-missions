	@file_name: fn_fuelConsumption.sqf
	@file_author: Kasteelharry & Gehock

	Description:
	Modifies the speed of which fuel is drained from the vehicle. Called from the vehicle init or debug console on server side.

	Parameters:
	0: OBJECT - the vehicle the code is called on; _this if called from vehicle init or variable name if called from debug console
	1: NUMBER - the speed of the fuel leak in seconds, a number from 1 to 0; 1 is the entire fuel tank, 0 is nothing. (for 30 minutes use 0.00055 and 45 minutes use 0.00037)

	Example:
	When calling from the 3den Editor Object Init or
	When using the init mid operation make sure the execution mode is set to Global:
	[_this, rateOfLeak] spawn ZO_fnc_fuelConsumption;

	When calling from the debug console:
	[nameOfVehicle, rateOfLeak] spawn ZO_fnc_fuelConsumption;

	Returns:
	Nothing.
